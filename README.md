🚀 My Frontend Mini Projects Collection – Learn, Build, Grow

In the old gurukul of craftsmanship, a learner was known not by words but by the work of their hands. In the same timeless spirit, this GitHub repository is my digital workshop — a place where ideas turn into code, and practice slowly becomes mastery.

Welcome, my friend.
Here you’ll find a growing collection of small yet powerful frontend projects, each built with patience, curiosity, and a forward-looking mindset. These projects are not just demos — they are stepping stones on the long road of becoming a skilled web developer.

This repository reflects my journey of learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, one project at a time.
